During Mail.ru Techsphere course "ML algorythms" i implemented ML algorythms:
- Knn (MyKNeighborsClassifier class)
- Decision tree (MyDecisionTreeClassifier class)
- Logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent (MySGDClassifier class)
- K-means clustering (MyKmeans and MyMiniBatchKMeans classes)
- EM clustering on Gaussian Mixture (EMGaussianMixture class, work with problems)
Here they are. All classes have methods "fit" and "predict".
